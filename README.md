# SearchPDFs
A python script that searches through all pdf files in a folder for a word or phrase.

This is one of the very first python scripts I wrote, and I have since learnt it does many things in inefficient/silly ways. 

I am not a programmer and do not purport to be a programmer; I am a law student. This was created 
  (a) to experiment; and 
  (b) help me get through a lot of sources in a limited amount of time.
